# Summative Assessment: Java Tools and Language Concepts

This assessment contains coding exercises that evaluate your understanding of Java tools and language concepts.

## Structure

* All code must reside in one IntelliJ project called `U1-M1-Summative-Lastname-Firstname`.
* Each exercise (listed in the Requirements/Features section below) must be contained its own Java file. Each Java file must contain a ```main``` method and must be named as directed in the exercise instructions.

## Requirements/Features

### Exercise 1: Month Converter (Conditionals)
This program converts a number entered by the user into a month. You must provide one version that uses an if/else/else-if structure and one version that uses a switch statement. 

Your solution must consist of the following two files:
* ```MonthConverterIf```
* ```MonthConverterSwitch```

The program must do the following:
1. Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 12.
1. Print out the name of the month corresponding to the number typed in by the user.
1. Print out the following error message if the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 12: "You have entered an invalid number. You must enter a number between 1 and 12. Goodbye."


### Exercise 2: Valid Number (Loops)
This program prompts the user for a number between 1 and 10 and keeps asking until the entered number is in range. Your solution must be in a Java file called ```ValidNumber```.

The program must do the following:
1. Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10.
1. If the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 10, display the following error message and prompt the user for another entry: "You must enter a number between 1 and 10, please try again."
1. When the user enters a valid number, print the number to the screen and exit.


### Exercise 3: Some Math (Methods)
In this program, you will create three methods and call them from ```main``` with the specified parameters. Your solution must be in a Java file called ```SomeMath```.

1. Create a method called ```total5```.  This method must take 5 int parameters and return the total. You must call the method with the following parameters and print the returned total to the screen: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1. Create a method called ```average5```. This method must take 5 int parameters and return the average of the numbers as a double. You must call the method with the following parameters and print the returned average to the screen: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
1. Create a method called ```largest5```. This method must take 5 double parameters and return the largest. You must call the method with the following parameters and print the returned value to the screen: 42.0, 35.1, 2.3, 40.2, 15.6.

### Exercise 4: Array Fun (Arrays)
Each of the items in this exercise must be contained in a separate Java file with a ```main``` method as specified below.

1. This solution must be contained in a Java file called ```ArrayFunUserArray```. Your code must read 5 ints from the user, put them in an array, and print the array elements to the screen.
1. This solution must be contained in a Java file called ```ArrayFunReverseIt```. Your code must declare the following array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], create another array of equal length, and fill that array with values from the original array but in reverse order. Finally, your code must print the contents of both arrays to the screen.
1. This solution must be contained in a Java file called ```ArrayFun5Words```. Your code must get 5 words from the user, put them in an array, and print the array elements to the screen.
